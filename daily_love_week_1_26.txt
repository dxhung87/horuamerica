Your generosity shines above all of your other qualities in the beginning of the week, but be careful not to try to buy someone's love. Lead with your personality, not your bank account. If you aren't sure if the moment is right to profess your love over the weekend, then it probably isn't. There's a lot to be said for being patient and waiting until everything is perfect to express your emotions.
