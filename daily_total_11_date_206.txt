You may say one thing one minute and the opposite the next, Pisces. Most of the time you jump from one issue to the next with no hassle, but today people probably will call you on it. Think about what you mean before you say it. Don't do all your thinking aloud so others can hear. Your continuous thought process might be mistaken for your final analysis. Confusion could ensue.
