Tension could rise this week, particularly with Mars facing off with Pluto in the days ahead, which can coincide with control battles. This blend of energies is also a call to listen to what others have to say and compromise when necessary. If you've been calling the shots lately, it's possible that others may resent this. If you want to foster positive relationships, the celestial backdrop hints that the way ahead includes good communication and ongoing discussion.
