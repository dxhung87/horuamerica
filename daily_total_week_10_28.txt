It wouldnâ€™t be surprising if you were more emotional than usual this week. If so, it might help to lighten your schedule and perhaps delegate some of your work. The reason may be due to an awkward aspect that could bring up feelings from the past. If you let these color your experience, then doing so could affect your work and any key decisions. Talking things through with a trusted friend or confidant can help you feel more settled.
