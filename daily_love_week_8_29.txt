Keep things casual if you go on any dates in the beginning of the week. A formal setting puts an awkwardness in the air that is hard to get past. Adrenaline-producing activities are great ice-breakers over the weekend, and you might find your perfect match doing something outdoors. You donâ€™t have to agree on everything, but having at least one common interest is a great starting point.
