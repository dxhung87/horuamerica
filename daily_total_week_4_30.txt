There is a positive shift in the air this week that will enliven and invigorate you. As Mars, followed by the Sun, enters your sign, you will feel you’re in your element and ready to tackle the next big project or make some significant changes. Prior to this, it would help to be careful about what you promise, as an impulsive yes to a request could mean you aren’t able to fulfill it. It might be better to first reflect on what is involved.
