You have a tremendous ability to understand the inner workings of any situation, Libra. You may need to give someone a reality check to make sure they're on the same page as you. Use your criticism constructively so you don't alienate yourself from the people. Help to fill in the blanks in a situation that isn't fully understood by all parties, and move the project to the next level.
