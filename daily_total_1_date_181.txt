You're feeling frisky today, Taurus, and you're happy to take the lead. It seems like the starting gate has just opened and you're leading the charge. The one thing that could put a damper on the race is your rational mind reminding you that it's also important to stop. Look around and reflect on what's going on around you. Incorporate both energies into your day.
