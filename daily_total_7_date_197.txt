You might host a social event in your home tonight, Scorpio. You may be nervous at first, wondering if all will go well. Your efforts should produce the results you want. You might be introduced to new contacts, which could lead to increased professional opportunities. Take a walk after everyone has gone. Your mind will be going a thousand miles an hour and you will want to clear your head.
