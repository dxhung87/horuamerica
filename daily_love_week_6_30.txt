Everyone has baggage from past relationships, so it isn’t logical to expect someone not to. Try to look at a person’s good characteristics rather than dwell on the negative at the start of the week. If you’ve been putting off something lately, it could catch up to you over the weekend. If your mind is too preoccupied to focus on a date, reschedule it. The other person deserves your undivided attention.
