Focus on yourself as the week begins. There's plenty of time to date. Just do you for now and the rest will fall into place. You aren't in a joking mood over the weekend, so the energy is off when a date tries to make light of something you consider to be a serious situation. Can you get past it? If not, don't make plans for a second date that you have no intention of keeping.
