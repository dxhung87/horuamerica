You may be indecisive today, Sagittarius. You may not be able to find solutions you can live with. You don't need to finalize anything now. Use this day to lay low and gather data. People may seem rather insensitive and erratic. Go with the flow. You have a great deal of warmth and passion to share. You may find that a strong, unpredictable force is affecting your emotions.
