A love partner may seem too quiet, Gemini. Perhaps you haven't heard from your friend for a day or so. If you let it, this could start your doubts and insecurities, causing you to wonder if this person still cares or if they're gone forever. Try to remain objective. Does your friend have some worries right now? That may be why they're out of touch. Worry will only make you feel worse.
