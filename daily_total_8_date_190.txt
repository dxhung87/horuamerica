The more you vacillate, the more valuable time and energy you waste, Sagittarius. Take a decisive stance and be confident about your choice. Give it everything you've got. If it doesn't work out, try a different approach. Don't be paralyzed by indecision. Things are moving too quickly. Take control of your life or someone else will.
