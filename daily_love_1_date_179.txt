Sometimes things happen in very surprising ways with planetary energies like today's. Later, when you look back at this incident and at how it began, it could seem like some very strange, yet happy accident of fate, and yet you also get the impression that it was no coincidence. The person you meet seems like the answer to a prayer, one you have held in your heart for a long time.
