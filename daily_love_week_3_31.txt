If you need a new outfit for a date at the start of the week, go for something vintage or shop at a small boutique that carries styles that are different from those in the chain stores. The way to wow someone new is with a totally unique first impression. You don’t like to talk about taboo topics over the weekend, so your perfect date isn’t someone who enjoys controversy. Stay away from extroverts who are just looking for attention.
