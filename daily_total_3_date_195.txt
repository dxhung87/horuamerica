A friend may seem in a dark and gloomy mood and unwilling to talk about it. Don't force the issue. This probably has more to do with your friend's circumstances than with you, Cancer. It's best if you continue to pursue your cherished goals. Not only could you advance your interests but you might also inspire your friend and bring him or her out of the dumps. Go for the gold.
