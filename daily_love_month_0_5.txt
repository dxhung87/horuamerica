A Venus/Saturn trine on June 1 has you searching for someone you can be honest with and loyal to, but it isn't easy. The wait may be long, but finding someone worthy of your undying love is the payoff. A Sagittarius Full Moon on June 9 gets a nod from Saturn, which gives a time of simple endings a more complicated plot. When problems arise, solve them by being balanced and fair. A Mars/Jupiter square on June 25 causes you to doubt the obvious, but it's only a matter of time before you can gather the evidence you need. Telling a critic "I told you so" will be sweet.
