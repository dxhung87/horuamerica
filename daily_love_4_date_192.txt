There could be a reason to feel irritated with your partner (current or prospective). The current astral energy indicates that if you have been trying to sweep a certain issue under the carpet because you are worried about your reaction, then you may feel encouraged to bring it out into the open. You don't have to be angry, just firm and self-assured. Look for a solution rather than seeking to blame.
