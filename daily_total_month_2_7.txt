The Moon/Mercury square on July 1 might try to shake your self-confidence, but don't let it. Feel rich under the July 8 Full Moon. You're in a moneymaking mood and you can see a lot of success. Someone else's sudden change of mood or fortune could create opportunities that let you show off how successful you can be. The July 23 New Moon could set off a season of parties and get-togethers with friends and neighbors who were hard to find earlier in the year. People may come and go more often, but it will be nice to see so many faces again.
