Did you agree to go out with one person and then get asked out by someone you’d rather spend time with? Having choices like this is a romantic conundrum, but deep down you know you’re going to honor your ethical obligation. If you put an emotional wall up around yourself over the weekend, there’s a good reason. Don’t answer any questions that make you feel uneasy. Listen to your inner voice.
