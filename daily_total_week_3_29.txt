Vitality is strong with the golden Sun and ruddy Mars moving through your sign. You may feel more courageous and inclined to stand up for what you believe in. But youâ€™ll also be eager to reach out and connect with old and new friends. Mercury in your financial sector could see you doing some organizing and getting up to speed with bills and other money matters. But if you spot a bargain for the home, you might not be able to resist it.
