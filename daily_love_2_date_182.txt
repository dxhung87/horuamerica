You may not be able to maintain your super-cool image under the influence of the current astral energy. Someone to whom you are extremely attracted manages to make you laugh hysterically, which is not the image you wished to portray. You may have hoped to retain a sense of calm dignity and wisdom, rather than total loss of control. But at least they can see that you are human.
