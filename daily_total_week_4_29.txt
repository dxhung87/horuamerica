You may have felt like taking a back seat lately, especially with your ruler Sun in a more secluded sector of your chart. But you may still feel very compassionate toward others and willing to lend your support. You would probably feel put out if they didn’t ask. If there have been issues between you and another, don’t take them personally. This person may have their own problems to contend with. Finally, you might be called on to help someone who needs some guidance.
