Have you recently met someone you feel could be your soul mate? Does he or she have all of the characteristics on your long-term checklist? That’s great, but don’t be in too big of a hurry to lock things down. There is still a lot to learn about each other. Rejection is your biggest fear over the weekend, and being embarrassed in front of a crowd isn’t fun at all. Wait until you feel more comfortable to make your move.
