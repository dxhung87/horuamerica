The coming week brings an opportunity to get clear about your intentions regarding a goal or career plan. This could be necessary if you're experiencing issues with a family member who might disagree with your ideas. However, the way you handle this issue can be very important. You may find that explaining your intentions very clearly is enough to make them feel better. Calm, sympathetic behavior works a lot better than getting involved in a spat, which would likely achieve nothing.
