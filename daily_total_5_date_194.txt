Someone who lives near you who may not have said much to you before could suddenly strike up a conversation that results in a new friendship, Virgo. You could be wondering why you didn't speak to him or her before. You could share a number of interests, and because of that, you could learn about some new group activities. Don't push too hard, and don't idealize your new friend.
