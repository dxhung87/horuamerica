Today you may want to be left alone with your thoughts. Relaxing with a good book could be at the top of your agenda, Aries, and you aren't likely to want to be interrupted. Noise and requests that don't usually bother you might irritate you, so it's best to spend some time alone and make the effort to be your usual considerate self when with others. Take a brisk walk to relieve the tension.
