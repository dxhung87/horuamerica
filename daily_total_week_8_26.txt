As the Sun and Mercury move into a more sensitive sector of your chart, you could be ready to face certain issues that have been holding you back for some time. These could be childhood experiences that created patterns that affect your progress at work or in key relationships. You may find that reflecting on them enables you to gently let them go. Counseling or therapy could work equally well at this time, if this option appeals to you.
