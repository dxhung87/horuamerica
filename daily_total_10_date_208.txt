No one is going to cater to your needs today, Aquarius, so get up and do things on your own. There's little sympathy from others, and strong opinions are a dime a dozen. There's a great deal of gossip buzzing around that you may be tempted to join. Don't enable this sort of behavior. It's only going to alienate you from others in the end.
