Mercury enters talkative Gemini on June 6, boosting communication. Conversations with strangers could lead to romance and so much more. Neptune retrograde begins on June 16, and so does an era of wishful thinking. No matter how much you wish for things, reality hits you like a cold glass of water in the face. Now that the fog has lifted, what are you going to do to improve your romantic circumstances? Someone could try to talk you into something during the Mercury/Pluto opposition on June 29, so try not let yourself be manipulated. The truth is easily hidden.
