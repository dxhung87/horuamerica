Friends could be very demanding this week, and you might have to be firm to keep them from taking advantage of you. There's a dynamic showing up that could coincide with control issues and misunderstandings. While it can be easy to sort out such matters with close friends, you might need to resort to other tactics with people you don't know so well. Putting firm boundaries in place and being honest about your feelings can be a good start.
