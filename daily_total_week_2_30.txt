You may easily absorb other peopleâ€™s energies this week, which could have an impact on certain decisions. In fact, Monday might not be the best time to commit to a path or try a new solution because your thinking may not be as clear as usual. But later your confidence will return as the celestial picture changes and your efforts to get organized and communicate produce results. You should have no difficulty in deciding what is best for you.
