The Full Moon on July 8 wants you to get serious about love. Even if you arenâ€™t super interested or motivated, love will not let you get off that easily. A partner may pressure you to do what you say or simply say more. The July 23 New Moon breaks a financial logjam and lets you realize a new income stream. It won't be clear or straightforward at first, but it will seem obvious once things begin to move. Venus moves into Cancer on July 31. Feel happier about the time you spend at home. Invite someone to visit.
