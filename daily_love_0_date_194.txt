Current astral energies could confuse certain issues within a close relationship that had been fairly clear. You both enjoy being together, but may not be able to come to any decisions about how you would like to progress in the future. Don't fret about this now, as this will make matters even more muddy between you, just enjoy what you have today. Tomorrow will take care of itself.
