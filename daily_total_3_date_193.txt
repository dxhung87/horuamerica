Possible ideas for artistic projects could come to you, Cancer, though some of them may be vague and not yet ready to manifest. You may seek to express your spiritual side through artistic activity, but might not quite have a handle on how to do it. Don't force it. Find something else to do and let it sit for a while. You might be surprised by the final results.
