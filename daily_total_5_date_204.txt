You may feel like you've come into the light today, Virgo. A weight has been lifted, but there is still a great deal of emotional drama that needs to work itself out. Go for a walk or jog this afternoon and work on increasing your lung capacity. Get your heart rate up and feel your blood pumping. The more active you are, the more you will be able to sort through your situation.
