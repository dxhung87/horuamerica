You tend to enjoy solitude, Leo, but today you might feel more reclusive than usual. Friends could invite you out, but you aren't likely to accept the offer. You might even feel a little irritated. This is a great day to work out or throw yourself into your own projects. Your concentration is good and the physical activity will get relieve the stress.
