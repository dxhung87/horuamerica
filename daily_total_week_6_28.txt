Thereâ€™s no need to pressure yourself this week, yet you may feel a need to push yourself. It might seem like the more you accomplish, the easier it will be to impress the right people. But deeper feelings could intrude, and you might begin to resent this approach. Instead of giving yourself more, try cutting back and delegating some work. With lovely Venus in your travel sector, a short but pleasant trip could revive you and perhaps your love life, too.
