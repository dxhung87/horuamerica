Your date this evening may not go entirely according to plan, but it won't be boring. Today's celestial energy encourages you to discover each other's intellectual preferences before you turn to more passionate matters. If you both have the same beliefs and ideals, then everything else will fall into place. If there is no meeting of minds, then no matter how hard you try, it may not last.
