When it comes to decisions, Sagittarius, do what's best for you today. Don't feel like you need to perform certain tasks just because of guilt over a past situation. Do things because you want to, not because you feel obligated to someone else. The only obligation you have is to you. If it's truly your desire to help someone out, then go for it, but don't sacrifice too much of yourself in the process.
