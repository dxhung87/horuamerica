Your perfect match at the start of the week is someone you can laugh and joke around with. The more serious someone is, the less you want to be around the person. It's hard to talk about relationship issues with someone who only wants to argue over the weekend, so try to avoid touchy or taboo topics on a first date. Politics and religion are both conversations for at least the third date (or later).
