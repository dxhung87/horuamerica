Don't automatically assume that you can work out all your problems alone, Libra. Just talking things out with others may help shed light on a situation that baffled you earlier. Enlist the help of others in areas where you need it. Don't be ashamed to ask for assistance. We all have problems and issues to deal with. You aren't alone.
