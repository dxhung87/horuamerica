There’s a focus on relationships, especially with the affable Sun and Mars lighting up your relationship zone and enticing you to explore the potential in a new friendship or budding romance. What interests you about another might be a story they tell or an experience they’ve had that captures your imagination and leaves you wanting more. But business affairs also look lively, as another positive connection encourages a meeting that could lead to a new project or contract.
