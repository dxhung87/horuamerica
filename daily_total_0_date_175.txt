Lay low today, Aries. Don't try to force any answers from people. Eat a healthy breakfast and stay away from caffeine. Relate to people on an intellectual or philosophical level and discuss the meaning of life. If you're looking for sympathy, you may need to wait a couple days. People aren't in the mood. They just want to be left alone.
