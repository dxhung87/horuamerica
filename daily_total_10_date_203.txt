The pace of things is likely to slow compared to what it was yesterday, Aquarius. This is probably best. Take this time to plan and stabilize. You've plowed, sown, and reaped the fields. Now stop and assess what you've produced and decide what to do with it. Take things one step at a time and don't get ahead of yourself. Be patient and things will naturally come your way.
