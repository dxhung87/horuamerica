The energy of the day is erratic, and you will probably be hopping all over the place, Aquarius. Don't worry about trying to firm up any plans at this time. You may feel like you're trying to grab a slippery fish with greased hands. If so, don't worry about it. Let the fish swim away for now. Relax. You can always catch another one later if you need to.\n</p>
