Work on using the right words at the start of the week. You can't help but get tongue-tied around the person you like, but if you focus on what you want to say instead of staring at that beautiful face, you have a better chance of being coherent! Doing things you're good at can lead to romance over the weekend, especially if you're in a casual environment. It's easy to turn work into romance.
