A Mercury/Uranus square on July 4 causes unfortunate and unpredictable communication glitches, which can put a major crimp in your dating style. Spellcheck helps, but it isn’t infallible. A Venus/Jupiter trine on July 18 allows you to overlook the potential negatives of a romantic situation, which is fine so long as you aren’t totally blind to all possible outcomes. Being optimistic is good. Being naïve isn’t. Your emotions are heightened when Venus enters sensitive Cancer on July 31. Avoid co-dependent relationships in which others can take advantage of your nurturing nature.
