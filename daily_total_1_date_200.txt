You might have the desire for travel, perhaps to visit a friend who lives far away, Taurus. You may actually set the wheels in motion to make it happen. Social events could take up your time this evening, and you could meet some interesting people. A friend might need a sympathetic ear. Today you're especially sensitive to others, so be prepared to hear a sad story. Otherwise, your day should go well.
