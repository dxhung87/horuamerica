There's no excuse for laziness today, Cancer. Get out of bed before noon. The more active you are, the happier you will be. Come out of your cave and express your thoughts to others. Get out in the open air and listen to what the wind has to say. Be active and flexible. There's nothing heavy about people's emotions today, so keep things light and active.\n</p>
