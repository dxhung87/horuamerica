The Full Moon on July 8 gives you the energy to make a major change at home. You might turn something or some space upside down. Or you might indulge in a big family gathering that improves a relationship in a big way. You may feel like you're all over the map during the New Moon on July 23. Don't fret. Eventually, one or two paths of action or interests will rise to the top and win your less scattered attention. The Sun/Mars conjunction on July 26 should fire you up and power you through the end of the month. Get busy!
