Stop hiding behind your intellectual barrier, Scorpio. Playing games will get you nowhere. True strength is standing up and demonstrating that you can say what you feel in any situation, especially regarding a close loved one. If you feel the need to say something, say it. Don't wait until the situation escalates to an unhealthy argument before you finally get your feelings out.
