You could be tempted by vintage chic and other objects from the past. You might enjoy browsing through secondhand shops and seeing what treasures you can uncover. Not all of it will be worth purchasing, though, so it pays to be choosy and find those items that you could sell if they don't seem to suit you. This can be an opportunity to remove clutter from your home and sell items you no longer need, raising extra cash in the process.
