You probably aren't going to feel like socializing even though friends want you to go out with them. Your patience could be worn a bit thin, Aquarius, and you may get annoyed at incidents that normally wouldn't bother you. This isn't a good day for group activities or parties. It might be best to get a good workout and then rest. You will feel much better afterward.
