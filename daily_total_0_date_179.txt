Things may be moving a bit too quickly today for you to grab hold of anything, Aries. There's an element of the unexpected entering into the equation. Be prepared. The mood of the day is especially light and perhaps a bit superficial. People may not be entirely reliable. If there's something you absolutely need to do, consider doing it by yourself.
