One of the perks of being single is that you don’t have to check in with your sweetie before you buy something. Take advantage of your solo buying power at the start of the week, and be silently thankful that you can purchase what you want, when you want it! You have a critical eye at week’s end, but being superficial doesn’t work to your advantage. You know better than to judge a book by its cover.
