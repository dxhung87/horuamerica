The current aspect at play indicates that it may be better to get a break from your partner (current or prospective) and loved one, and take this opportunity to go off by yourself and do all the things that make you feel uplifted and recharged. You both need some space to get back in touch with yourselves, and will enjoy the time alone, which makes the reunion later so much more fun.
