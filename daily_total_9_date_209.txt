It's important to get outside and feel the wind, Capricorn. Reconnect with nature and be aware of the four elements, especially the air. Take deep breaths and fill your lungs with the energizing life force. Imagine yourself on a mountain looking over a vast ocean. Expand your awareness so that nothing escapes your attention. Keep your head clear of clutter and be open to new adventures.
