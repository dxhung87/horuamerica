On June 4, Mars entering Cancer brings your emotions to the surface, but pushing yourself to be too bold or expressive may backfire. The struggle continues to find balance between logic and passion. With a Sun/Mercury conjunction on June 21, you tend to ignore what's right in front of your face. Has someone been dropping not so subtle hints of their interest? Open your eyes and look at the possibilities! You have a special gift for seeing past other people's insecurities during the Mars/Neptune trine on June 25, which is a great dating tool. Give compliments freely and honestly.
