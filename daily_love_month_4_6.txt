You have some interesting and novel ideas about romance during the Mercury/Uranus square on July 4, but you have trouble following through. Don’t promise more than you can deliver, because giving a new romantic prospect the wrong idea will only lead to disappointment down the line. You’re particularly engaged during the Venus/Jupiter trine on July 18, and you’re eager to try new things. As you welcome these experiences, try to let go of past negative ones. The Sun and Mars conjoin in Leo on July 26, giving you the courage to ask someone out again. If it’s no again this time, maybe you should move on.
