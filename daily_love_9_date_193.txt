The current planetary alignment does not really create the perfect energy for a first date. There are strong possibilities that in some way or another you will manage to rub each other the wrong way. This doesn't have to be so if you can manage not to rock the boat, yet even you like to ruffle feathers if you are feeling especially wicked. Don't overdo it!
