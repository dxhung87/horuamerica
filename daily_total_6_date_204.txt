Take a break from your steady climb today, Libra. Look at things around you. Enjoy a night out with friends and take an active role in the conversation. See a movie or play. Do more socializing and you will be able to release some of the tension that you might not even realize you have inside. Get the energy moving again. Take an active role and keep up with the beat.
