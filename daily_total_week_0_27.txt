You may feel like retreating from life and taking some time to nurture yourself. With a focus on your home zone, it could pay to spend more time reading a good book, eating wholesome food, and getting plenty of sleep. See this as your personal retreat in which you get to pamper yourself and spend time with your nearest and dearest. While you still have to interact with the world, make a point of taking care of your needs to restore your vitality.
