When you look into your romantic future at the start of the week, what do you see? If you're worried about things that haven't even happened yet, try to calm down and rationalize. Being overly emotional isn't helping. Parts of the weekend could be stressful, especially if there are relatives or friends around who insist on criticizing your love life. Make it clear that your business is just that - your business.
