Someone close to you might seem more preoccupied than usual, Sagittarius, and perhaps a bit difficult to deal with. Don't take this personally. It has little, if anything, to do with you. This person has troubles of their own that they don't want to share. You might be feeling a bit tense and jumpy, but again, this is nothing to worry about. Take a walk or work out at the gym.
