Responsibilities to work, family, or both could temporarily delay plans for a much-needed vacation. This could be a bit depressing, Virgo, but don't let it get you down. Take care of your responsibilities as quickly as you can and then move ahead with your plans. All signs are that this trip is important to you and should go ahead as scheduled.
