If you've been admiring someone from afar, the start of the week is a good time to step up a little closer and get to know them. Sometimes the reality isn't as good as the fantasy, but at least you'll know one way or the other. The end of the week is perfect for romance, especially soft lighting and mood music. If you can't seduce someone under these circumstances, you probably aren't trying hard enough.
