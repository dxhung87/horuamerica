You have a great idea for a couples’ project in the first part of the week, but no one to share it with. Have patience as you await your next partner, because finding the right one will be worth it! An emotional moment takes you by surprise over the weekend, but it goes to show you how truly attached you are to someone. You’ve managed to be flip about your feelings until now, but it’s time to show your hand.
