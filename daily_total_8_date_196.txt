Today may prove to be one of your busiest in a long time, Sagittarius. The promise of continuing success in your personal and professional goals could find you spending a lot of time on the phone, writing emails, or making a few short trips around the community. You might not be able to reach everyone you need to see. Don't worry. Be persistent and you will reach them eventually.
