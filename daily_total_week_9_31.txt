If youâ€™re viewing life more intensely, this might be because the Sun and Mars have just entered a more emotional sector of your chart. Your attention may be drawn to financial matters and how you can make your money work harder for you. You could also be aware of deeper currents that encourage you to work through issues that have been on the back burner for some time. Discussing these with the right person could help you make a dramatic shift in your life.
