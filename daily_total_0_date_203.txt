Little voices whisper in your ear and ask you to take flight and join them in the clouds, Aries. There's tension between what your heart and mind tell you. They're pulling you in very different directions. Don't be surprised if today's energy leaves you confused by sunset. Don't stress about making hard decisions or commitments.
