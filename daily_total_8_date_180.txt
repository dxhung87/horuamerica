Don't wait for an invitation to speak your mind, Sagittarius. No one will ask what you think. Express yourself. You've given other people plenty of time to have their say. It's now time to chime in with your opinion. Don't be an observer. Be an active player and help shape the conversation and the events of the day with your powerful words and thoughts.
