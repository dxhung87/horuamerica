Commanding Mars barrels into Cancer on June 4, and you may have trouble getting your romantic footing. You want to move forward, but the direct approach isn't your best option. The Sun enters Cancer on June 20, so you focus on home, family, and nurturing for the next month. If you're looking for a long-term partner, it's imperative that you find someone who agrees that these things are important. A Mercury/Jupiter square on June 27 interferes with your ability to tell truth from fabrication, so you may fall for shallow people with less than honorable intentions. At least you can see through those flimsy one-liners.
