A close friend or romantic partner may seem in a rather quiet mood, Leo, and disinclined to communicate with you. You might wonder if this person is angry with you or if you've said or done something that wasn't OK. It's likely that what's bothering your friend has more to do with work, family, or money than with you. Just make it clear that you're there if needed.
