Stay calm under the Mars/Pluto opposition on July 2. It isnâ€™t your fault. Love seeks you out at the Full Moon of July 8. You may not feel ready, but it will do no good to run or hide. All this attention might make you nervous for a while, but you could have a change of heart and warm up to it. The July 23 New Moon may complicate your life and toss some distractions your way, but you can handle it. Be patient and let a problem fully appear before addressing it. Halfway measures or half-hearted attempts will only add to the confusion.
