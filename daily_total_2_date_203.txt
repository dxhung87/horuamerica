You might experience a great deal of emotional confusion, Gemini. There's a debate brewing inside you, and you're having a hard time deciding whether to be practical or more fanciful. Looking to others for help may only add to the problem, so take other people's advice with a grain of salt. If nothing seems clear, wait out the storm and proceed when you have a better handle on the weather.
