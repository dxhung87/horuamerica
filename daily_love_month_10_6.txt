The July 5 Sun/Neptune trine brings a heightened sense of connection, so networking groups and matchmaking sites are particularly helpful. You know that “meant to be” feeling you had when you met that certain someone? There’s probably something to it. The Sun enters confident Leo on July 22, and when you’re sure of yourself you can reach some pretty lofty romantic goals. Now that you’re in love’s spotlight, what will your act be? You’re looking for a stimulating union during the Mars/Sun conjunction on July 26, and only someone who shares your eccentricity will do. If you can’t be odd together, it might not work.
