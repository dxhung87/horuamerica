A Capricorn Full Moon on July 9 puts a serious focus on your love life. Now that one phase has ended, you’re free to set new (and preferably long-term) goals. Powerful Mars enters extroverted Leo on July 20, meaning passion and a desire for adventurous affairs drive the next six weeks. You can never let yourself act completely without thinking, but you’re less prone to fussing over the details. You take your time communicating when Mercury enters earthy Virgo on July 25. You’d rather take an hour to respond to a text than hit “send” prematurely. Messages full of spelling and grammar errors are unacceptable.
