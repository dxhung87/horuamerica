Doing the best for everyone may mean that plans become watered down and no easy solution presents itself. You may find yourself in this situation over the next day or so, and it could be because you don’t want to upset anyone. You may have no option, as someone will criticize you whatever you decide. Just do what seems best to you and don’t worry what others say. You’ll be in a lighter and brighter space by the weekend anyway.
