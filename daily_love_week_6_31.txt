You have great love-related advice at the start of the week. Even though you arenâ€™t currently in a long-term relationship, you still have good stories and relatable experiences to share that can help those who are going through tough times. The weekend has you bouncing from one social event to the next, so you barely have time to miss having a significant other. In the rare quiet moments, try not to reflect too much on what might have been.
