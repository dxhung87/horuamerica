The name of the game today is action, Capricorn. The air has cleared, and it feels like a weight has been lifted off your shoulders. You might experience a sudden burst of physical energy, pushing you to get out and walk or go for a long bike ride. Enjoy the wind in your hair. Release your pent-up emotions in the open air.
