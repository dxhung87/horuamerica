If there's an issue with your partner that needs airing, this is a good time to do it, Cancer. Don't hold back just to maintain the equilibrium in the relationship. Don't sacrifice your peace of mind just to keep from rocking the boat. Refusing to face reality just to keep up an easy facade isn't doing anyone a bit of good. Be totally honest with yourself, your feelings, and other people.
