Don't worry so much about getting things done today, Libra. Instead, concentrate on your feelings and relationships. A caring, sensitive attitude is needed, as opposed to a harsh, militant way of dealing with things. You will find that by adopting a tender, nurturing tone, people will be much more receptive to you in general.
