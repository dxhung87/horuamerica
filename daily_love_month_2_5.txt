A Sun/Neptune square on June 4 has muddled energy, so trying to fool someone might result in fooling yourself. This isn't the most enlightened aspect, so don't proceed with a relationship thinking you have it all figured out (you probably don't). Mercury exits your breezy sign and enters Cancer on June 21, changing the way you like to communicate. Instead of keeping conversations short and logic based, you could wax poetically for hours. A Mars/Neptune trine on June 25 expands your mind and helps you see things not just for what they are but for what they could be. Your romantic idealism is admirable.
