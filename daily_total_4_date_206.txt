The intensity of the day may bring unexpected opposition, Leo. Whether it's verbalized or not, the confrontations are quite real. Don't underestimate a loved one's emotions. Stand up to these issues and be realistic about their solutions. No one expects you to have all the answers, so don't pretend to. We're all human and we all make mistakes.
