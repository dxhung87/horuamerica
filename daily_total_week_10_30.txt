Go easy with your money at the week’s start, as something that seems worth purchasing could turn out to be a disappointment. Save your cash for something that’s worth your while. Tuesday could also be a day of indulgence, but your chart suggests that this could be good for you. You’ll be ready to knuckle down and get some work done on Wednesday. From here, a shift occurs and the emphasis moves to your sector of relating, encouraging a lot more interaction.
