A good, solid match in the first part of the week is someone who will help stretch your boundaries. Opposites do attract at times, so don’t be afraid to venture outside of your usual type to meet someone new. Family emergencies or dramas keep you busy over the weekend, so you might have to postpone a date you were looking forward to. If the other person isn’t flexible about rescheduling, he or she might not be right for you.
