People and situations egg you on today, Libra. It may seem like there's contention around every corner. Remember that your path is the one that you chose. You may or may not have anticipated the barriers, but they're unavoidable. The key to success is to strike the right balance between inner and outer activities. Don't direct all your frustration at others. Don't hold it all in, either.
