On June 3, a Sun/Jupiter trine enriches an already agreeable situation or relationship. The Full Moon on June 9 brings around all your friends and neighbors, or so it may seem. If you're not up for hosting a party, let someone else do it and drop in for a bit. Jupiter goes direct in Libra that day, too. Now, that makes it party time! Step into the limelight at work during the June 23 New Moon. A career advance or bigger project may appear for you, or you could suggest such a move and your superior will see the wisdom of it.
