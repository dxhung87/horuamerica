If you spend the day at home, Aquarius, the walls may seem to close in around you. Squabbles over nothing could erupt between you and other household members, and a lack of energy could plague you. This is a good day to get some exercise. Take a walk, ride a bike, or take a cardio class. This should work off your frustrations while creating more physical energy.
