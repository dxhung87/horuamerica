Adopting an easygoing approach when dealing with others can help this week proceed more smoothly. There could be a tendency to want to be in control of proceedings, and some people might find this hard to handle, preferring to make up their own minds. If you can give others the leeway to come to their own conclusions, you may find their input very helpful. Youâ€™re likelier to attract their support, too. Great tact may be needed at the Full Moon on July 8.
