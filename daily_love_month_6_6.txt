When Venus visits Gemini on July 4, your velvet tongue paves the way for many dating adventures. Smart is sexy, and you’re looking intelligent as heck! It’s hard to control your nervous energy during the Mars/Uranus square on July 17, so you may say or do uncharacteristically unrefined things on a first date. It’s never too late to recover, but try not to let the awkwardness go too long without addressing it. A lingering but indescribable fear prevents you from moving forward during a Venus/Saturn opposition on July 24. If you can’t pinpoint and remedy the problem, wait to act when you’re feeling more confident.
