You choose quality over quantity every time, so it doesn’t matter how many admirers you have at the week’s start. If they aren’t people you can imagine sharing your life with, they won’t even get a first date. You can spend time with your couple friends over the weekend without feeling jealous or lonely, but you prefer not to be a third wheel. Blind dates and last-minute setups can be pretty fun if you keep an open mind.
