The Sun and Mercury move into your sign midweek, bringing an end to a period in which you've been more inward looking. Now the cosmos encourages you to express yourself and reveal more of your true nature. This can also be a chance to manifest those ideas that you've been dreaming up in recent weeks. With a New Moon in Cancer on Friday, this is a perfect time to get started on a project that is deeply meaningful to you.
