People aren't going to want to be quite as intense as you require today, Leo. Things are light and airy. You may find that no one is in the mood to delve as deeply as you want to go. Use the day to relax and release control for a while. Take deep breaths and long walks. Go for a bike ride or short road trip. Crazy, unexpected events may crop up throughout the day. Be prepared for surprises.
