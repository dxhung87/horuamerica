If the week starts on an awkward note, donâ€™t let it stop you. Someone may refuse to listen to your suggestions, but they may come around to your way of thinking if you can be patient. Even so, creative ideas can flow, and you may find the coming days helpful for kick-starting a new project or business enterprise. Cultural activities could also inspire you. If you visit an exhibition or concert, you might get ideas you can apply to your own art or craft.
