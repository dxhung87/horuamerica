If you feel this way at the start of the week, it might be more beneficial to stick with an idea or project and see it through to the end, as your efforts wonâ€™t then be wasted. As the focus shifts to your home zone, the cosmos encourages you to take a step back and indulge in a bit of pampering and self-care.
