There is a lot more to the person you’re interested in than what meets the eye. Ask probing questions in the beginning of the week that will help you get to know the person underneath the attractive exterior. You look good and you know it over the weekend, so you expect a lot of compliments. If someone doesn’t fawn over you, they might not be your perfect match. Then again, a challenge can be fun.
