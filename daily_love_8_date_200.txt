The astral configuration may mean that your love life exists more in your head right now than it does in reality. Perhaps you have not seen your loved one for some time, and have only thoughts or fond memories to keep you going; or perhaps they live far away and so your main source of contact is the phone. Whatever the scenario, it is certainly time you saw each other.
