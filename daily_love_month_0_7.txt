When Venus enters Gemini on July 4, you’re the kind of flirt who knows what to say, how to say it, and whom to say it to! In other words, you have no problem coming up with tempting one-liners and steamy invites. You’re disappointed by a crush during the Venus/Neptune square on July 17, and realizing the truth about the person could be eye opening. At least it’s better to find out now than waste more time pining away. Mars enters extroverted Leo on July 20 and you’re easily aroused. Don’t just settle for the first person you see. Look for someone with long-term potential.
