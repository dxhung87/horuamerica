Whatever skills or talents you're using to accomplish your present goals may seem blocked, Aries. This could give rise to a sense of frustration if you let it, but don't fall into this trap. If you can't get motivated, focus on something else, perhaps an activity you've never tried before. This could get your mind going again while allowing your other skills to pick up steam.
