A temporary lack of funds might interfere with creative projects or your ability to have fun, Capricorn. You might encounter an apparent coolness from a close friend or romantic partner that you might not understand. Don't make too much of it. This probably relates more to the person's general mood than to anything you've said or done. Your friend should be back to normal in a few days.
