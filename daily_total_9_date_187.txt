It's time to settle down from the rapid-fire activities of the past few days and retreat to a quieter state of mind, Capricorn. Take care of the details you failed to attend to while you were out having fun. Now is the time to turn inward and reflect. Rely on your inner reserves as opposed to your outwardly directed actions. Stay grounded and let your emotions work with your rational side.
