You have a unique perspective on the world, to put it mildly, so when you find someone who shares similar views in the beginning of the week, don’t let them go. At the very least, you’ll make a friend for life. And at best, it could be true love. Give up control of date plans over the weekend. It’s nice to have someone surprise you occasionally instead of you doing all the work.
