You have sweet memories of an ex in the first part of the week, so it's hard to understand why you aren't together. Sometimes circumstances are beyond your control, so try not to get held back by "what if." You put a lot of effort into a first date over the weekend, and it should pay off in all the right ways. Kissing someone new is surprising and exciting.
