When the going gets tough, you get going. You have an incredible amount of will, and you let very few things get in your way. When it comes to love, you rarely let past bad times interfere with future good ones. If you want to impress someone this weekend, don’t try too hard. You’re a master of subtlety, so playing hard to get can work to your advantage. The more you ignore the person, the more the person will want you!
