You might be unfocused and confused about which way to go, Sagittarius. Your baffled look isn't giving others much confidence in your ability to make a good decision. Don't feel obliged to stay in an unhealthy situation. It may be time to let go and break some ties to things that are no longer working for you. Feel good about extracting yourself from old habits.
