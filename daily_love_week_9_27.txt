Someone has liked you for a long time but you're just now noticing. Are you totally tuned in to your romantic intuition? If you're missing subtle clues, you may not be paying attention to your inner voice as much as you should be. Dates where food is involved are the best kind over the weekend. Grab a meal at a food cart or dine at a four-star restaurant. You can tell a lot about a date by what they order.
