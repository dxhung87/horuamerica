The alignment of the planets may mean you feel much more enthusiastic about a relationship that you have been complacent about recently. There is a lot of extra energy around that makes you more forthright and outspoken than usual, and also more insistent on getting your own needs met. This will enable you to play a more active role in the future - which makes life much more fun.
