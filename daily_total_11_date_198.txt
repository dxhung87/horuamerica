Uptight is the mood for today. You might be the center of attention at some point. While you normally wouldn't mind, Pisces, today it might make you nervous. When everyone looks at you and expects you to say something, say it. Keep it short and then withdraw. You aren't in the mood. Walk to the library and throw yourself into reading about subjects that interest you. This should relieve the stress.
