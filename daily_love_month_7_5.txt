Mars leaves Gemini for Cancer on June 4, leading you to become defensive rather quickly. Like this is something new. Is it possible someone is just trying to get to know you, or are you convinced they're trying to access your darkest secrets? Either way, you don't have to say anything you don't want to. A Sun/Saturn opposition on June 15 urges you to learn from past mistakes. If you don't, then you're almost certainly going to repeat them. Why go through the hassle twice? A New Moon in fellow Water Sign Cancer on June 23 empowers you emotionally. Congratulations! You're ready to take the next step.
