This is an important day to make valuable connections, Pisces. You will be engaged in fast-paced, witty conversations and debates from which you can learn a great deal. You're good at seeing both sides of an issue. The problem is that this can lead to indecisiveness and an inability to commit. Choose a path and stick to it.
