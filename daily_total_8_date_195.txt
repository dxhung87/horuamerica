You may wake up feeling strong and energetic, but as the day wanes, stress could cause you to feel tired and worn out. Be careful, Sagittarius. You could become short-tempered around others. This won't happen if you avoid the temptation to go like a house afire first thing in the morning. Pace yourself and your relations with others should remain excellent throughout the entire day.
