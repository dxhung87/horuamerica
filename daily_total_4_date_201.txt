The day doesn't begin until you clear your head and take stock of some pending personal issues, Leo. You might be making mountains out of molehills. Realize that there's a path for everybody. Put your stinger away today. It's powerful, but it won't do any good. Keep your power under wraps. Concentrate more on the mundane tasks that need to be done. Why not make a list?
