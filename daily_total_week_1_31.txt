You could experience delays with financial matters at the start of the week, but this phase is temporary. Things should be back to normal within a few days. Care with spending might be helpful, though, to enable you to stay on track. A focus on domestic matters could inspire you to get your place looking fabulous. This is a good time to reorganize your home so that it becomes a place of tranquillity as well as a place in which you enjoy entertaining.
