Do you have a good sounding board you can bounce ideas off of at the start of the week? You could move forward solo, but it's much better to get a second (and third) opinion about what you're doing wrong and what you could improve. People are attracted to your sense of self-worth and confidence over the weekend, so walk tall and with a sense of purpose. It's nice to be pursued romantically for a change.
