Today is a great day to jump out of bed and get things done, Sagittarius. You may feel indecisive, but don't sweat it. You don't have to make any great commitments. You will do fine jumping around from task to task. Get out into the open and say what's on your mind. Engage in some sort of physical activity that gets you breathing deeply.\n</p>
