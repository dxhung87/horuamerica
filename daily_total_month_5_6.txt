Your social life blazes with the July 8 Full Moon. You might prefer the company of a few eccentric, inspired people, but get ready to be surrounded by social butterflies of all stripes. Have fun. Great restlessness may come with the New Moon on July 23. Spend time alone doing things that are important to you. Or get together with an intimate friend or partner and share what only you and they can appreciate. The strongest emotional bonds can be formed now. Mercury enters Virgo on July 25. You could notice many small things to fix, but you'll feel great fixing them.
