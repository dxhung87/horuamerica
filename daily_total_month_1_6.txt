Your friends may have trouble keeping up with you around the Full Moon on July 8. There could be a desire to be more daring and outgoing. Be as outgoing as you please, but happiness may be easier to find with the familiar close to home. The Venus/Jupiter trine on July 18 could bring people your way and make you quite popular. Let the July 23 New Moon open a door to relatives who have been too busy or scattered to keep in touch. False communication may be the rule, but the texts or calls should be good signs of closer contact to come.
