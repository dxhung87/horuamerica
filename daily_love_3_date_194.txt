The current astral environment may indicate that your date this evening has very different values from yourself, and this may highlight a clash. You could both get on if you respect that you are essentially not on the same page and so enjoy learning more about how you both tick. But don't expect to share the same ideas or ideals. You could still have a great time, though.
