Someone has just turned on the fan and papers are flying everywhere, Capricorn. The pace is picking up and you're scrambling to pick up the pieces. Stay in close communication with others today, for this will be your saving grace. You may require others' help to gather the documents that have blown across the room. Keep an eye on things so you don't lose your place.
