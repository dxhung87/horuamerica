You aren’t attracted to the “good” guy or girl during the Mars/Pluto opposition on July 2, but what’s wrong with being bad once in a while? You’re single, so the choice of whom to date is entirely yours. You don’t feel your sexiest during the Mars/Uranus square on July 17, and there could be some awkward physical moments. You can’t always control what your body does, so try to make up for it with witty banter. Mercury loves its placement in Virgo, starting on July 25, mostly because it makes the thought process crystal clear. Love isn’t easy, but it doesn’t have to be complicated.
