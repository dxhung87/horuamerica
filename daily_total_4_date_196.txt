People close to you might be a bit worried about you, Leo. Too much work and socializing might have you feeling less than your usual self, and perhaps even a little feverish and headachy. If so, this is a good day to take time out, stay home, and rest. Don't worry about sabotaging your success. It will continue. Take a break and your body will reward you with greater clarity and concentration.
