At the Sun/Jupiter square on July 5, the key is doing a little less than you feel like doing. This aspect can lead to overconfidence, which could cause you to strive for a higher goal than is obtainable. Venus squares Neptune on July 17, this time causing the opposite – lack of self-belief! Second-guessing yourself when it comes to romance is a no-go, so wait to ask anyone out until you’re feeling more like yourself. You make your presence known during the Sun/Mars conjunction in Leo on July 26, so your invitations aren’t likely to be ignored. Taking a dignified, honorable approach to love is favored.
