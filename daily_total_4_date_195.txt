Professional interests might temporarily interfere with your social life, Leo. This might cause a little friction between you and a close friend or romantic partner. Your friend is more apt to want to brood than discuss it with you. Don't worry. This person will come out of the funk and be more understanding. Explain the situation the best you can and then continue with your work.
