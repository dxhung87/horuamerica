On the Full Moon of July 8, go for broke and follow your passion. Nothing will be able to stop you anyway. A big social event or invitation could come your way, but it won't linger, so act quickly. The Moon/Neptune conjunction on July 13 turns up the sensitivity and the intuition. Be more psychic, too. The New Moon on July 23 could disrupt sleep and confuse you with too many new, good-sounding ideas to improve your life. Keep everything simple and don't be lured in a new direction that sounds good at first. Don't be too eager for change.
