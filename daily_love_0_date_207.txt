The energy from today's astral configuration may give you the courage to ask someone absolutely sensational out for a meal. Not that you are usually short of words, but in this instance it is the age-old worry of being rejected by someone that you have grown to completely adore that is causing the problem. However, once you have gotten the words out, and they have been accepted - all will be well.
