There might be tension in the air for no discernible reason today. Family members might seem preoccupied with problems they can't define. Your natural inclination could be to try to cheer them up, Virgo, but it probably won't work. Don't be annoyed if they don't respond. It isn't them. Blame the planets. This is a great day to jog, take a cardio class, or otherwise work off stress.
