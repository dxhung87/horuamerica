Venus and Uranus make nice in the form of a conjunction on June 3, and you get the exciting residual effect of romantic sparks. You never know when you're going to feel incredible chemistry with someone new, so be ready. Mercury feels very at home when it enters Gemini on June 6, so your flirting game is exactly where it needs to be. A wink or similarly coy gesture helps seal the deal. A Pluto/Mercury opposition on June 29 could interfere with the flow of a date, especially if you both insist on being right. Don't cling to bad feelings after the conversation ends.
