Your expansive nature is reaching out to others, Scorpio, but you may run into opposition. Keep in mind that not everyone wants your advice. Give it only if someone asks for it. It may be in your nature to want to jump into people's lives and fix things. Resist that temptation. What people may need instead is someone to listen.
