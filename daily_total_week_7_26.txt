If you have a good feeling about a country or destination, this might spur you on to make travel plans. The same may be true if you're fond of someone who lives far away. You may also have a passionate interest in a subject and want to learn more or even write a book about it if you have enough experience. A passionate trend could also reveal strong emotions for someone nearer to home that you might be ready to share.
