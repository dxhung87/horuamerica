It may be hard for you to get a handle on things today, Aries. Your focus seems to jump from one problem to the next without finding resolution. This isn't a day to find a solution. You're better off researching, questioning, and gathering facts. Keep your channels of communication open, and don't try to pin anyone down for answers. You'll accomplish a lot by keeping active and light.
