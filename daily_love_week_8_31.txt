You’ve heard the term “lucky in love,” right? Well, it definitely applies to you at the start of the week! You don’t have to try very hard for all things romantic to go your way. It’s no wonder you’re having a hard time wiping that giant smile off your face. You may meet someone who seems antagonistic or contrary over the weekend, but it’s probably just an act. They may be trying to cover up some deep insecurity.
