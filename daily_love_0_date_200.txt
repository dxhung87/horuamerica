The astral configuration may mean that a lover from the past comes back into your life today. Whilst you may feel that you have changed for the better, you may not be quite so sure about them, as they seem to have grown more world weary and slightly disappointed with life. Discussing old times and talking through any problems with them will bring a smile back to their face.
