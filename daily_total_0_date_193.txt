Someone could call and want to share some troubles with you, Aries. Your sensitivity and compassion may attract more than one unhappy person in need of sympathy and advice. While this is flattering, it could be a bit of a drag as well. You aren't likely to turn these people away. Accept this as a natural consequence of being a good listener. And take care not to let these sad stories get to you.
