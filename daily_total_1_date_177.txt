Things aren't necessarily going to go well today, Taurus. There is the potential for conflict. You may feel a bit lost in the fog. Strap on your compass and you will be fine. Realize that you will make it through this day much better if you approach every situation from the other person's perspective. Think more of others than of yourself. Be sensitive and receptive.
