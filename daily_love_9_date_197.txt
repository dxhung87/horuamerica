A social evening could mean that one meeting proves to be an eye-opener in more ways than you can imagine. The current aspect breaks down a barrier that has existed between you and someone else with whom you secretly feel a powerful connection. Perhaps because of this you have been hesitant to speak to them; but an accident of fate means you have no choice. Thank goodness.
