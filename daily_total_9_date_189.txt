Put on a noble demeanor before you leave the house this morning, Capricorn. The key is to smile from ear to ear and just keep smiling. There's a great deal of power available to you, so put it to good use. Open your heart and freely express your love, because it will brighten up other people's lives, too. Keep your chin up, your shoulders back, and be proud.
