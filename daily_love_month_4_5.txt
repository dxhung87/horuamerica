A cheery Sun/Jupiter trine on June 3 lifts your mood and renews your faith that someone's out there for you. Being patient isn't easy, but at least you know you're working toward something. There's a Sagittarius Full Moon to look forward to on June 9, which should bring a sense of completion and fulfillment. Saturn's interference puts questions where there should be answers, but the overall effect isn't too worrisome. June 24 brings an interesting Venus/Pluto trine, at which point you're very perceptive about others' motivations. You don't mind if someone is only interested in you for one thing, but you want them to know you know!
