You don’t like to let your guard down at the beginning of the week, mostly due to trust issues stemming from the past. You aren’t usually one to dwell on things you can’t change, so something else might be going on. Figure out what that is before you take the next step. Your good mood is contagious over the weekend, and meeting other singles is easy. This is going to be fun!
