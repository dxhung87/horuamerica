Is someone making you jump through a lot of hoops just to talk to him or her? Is it worth it? You aren’t usually the type who can be molded, so the person must be pretty special if you’re trying to conform to someone else’s standards! If you have a budget in place over the weekend, you can still find fun things to do on a first date. Get creative. Be bold. Make it memorable despite the bargain price tag.
