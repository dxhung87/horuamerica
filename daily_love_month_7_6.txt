Words don’t always mean what you think they mean during the Mercury/Uranus square on July 4, so always follow up written communication with an actual conversation. Miscommunication and romance don’t mix. A favorable Mercury/Saturn trine on July 19 wakes you up and lets you see things that others may not, which puts you ahead of your romantic competition. Leave it to you to create openings where there were none! The feminine combination of Venus in Cancer on July 31 adds a hyper-sensitive element to your love life. The emotional ups and down are worth the potential payoff.
