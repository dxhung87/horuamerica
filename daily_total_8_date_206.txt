Stop trying to feel everyone else's emotions and focus on yours, Sagittarius. Being empathetic is certainly laudable, but at some point you need to face the music and look in the mirror. Make a clear distinction between your needs and those of others. Express your feelings. Ask for help if you need it. Other people aren't mind readers. They probably have no idea what you're feeling.
