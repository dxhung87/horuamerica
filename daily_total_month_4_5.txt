Let your inner child romp under the June 9 Full Moon. Get inspired and have more fun doing something ordinary in the most unordinary way. Every kid knows that pots and pans turned upside down are really drums in disguise. A Sun/Saturn opposition on June 15 gives you more authority than you expect. Around the June 23 New Moon, you may be wildly busy and involved in life, in an introverted way. If you've seen a change in a partnership or romance, take all the time you need to come to grips with it and make things turn out your way.
