The current celestial energy implies that you could have a truly wonderful evening with your latest love interest. The atmosphere is ripe for pure romance, which may not have anything to do with reality, but will be great fun in the meantime. While you are sipping pink champagne, eating oysters, and making gooey eyes at each other over the dinner plates, don't make too many ardent promises. Wait till you know each other better.
