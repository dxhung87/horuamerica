Feel energized - maybe hyper - during the June 9 Full Moon. Keep daily life simple and don't get distracted by any interruptions or the concerns of people who are much more scattered than you may feel. It's a busy time and lots of folks may be bouncing off the walls. The June 23 New Moon is pumped full of energy and ambition. It could be hard to think without getting emotional. If you avoid impatience or impulsiveness, you can do well. On June 28, a Mercury/Mars conjunction in Cancer gives you extra skill and power to accomplish something difficult that has been lingering.

Best days: 4, 10, 21
