Your partner may seem indecisive and irritable, with the current aspect at play. However, you may not be making things exactly easy by your attitude, either. You are both seeking to get away from restraints and limitations that you feel you are imposing on each other. Some time spent away, each doing your own thing, may help enormously. It will restore your connection to yourselves, and give your relationship a boost.
