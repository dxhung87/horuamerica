The current celestial configuration makes tonight's date quite an occasion. You will be in one of your more sociable and truly delightful moods. In this frame of mind you can make a joke out of absolutely anything, and can turn apparent disasters into triumphs of mirth. The only slight cause for concern is that you may spend so much time giggling that the conversation never really gets off the ground.
