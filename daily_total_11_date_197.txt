Trying to get too much work done in the course of the day could prove self-defeating, Pisces. Your energy isn't what it usually is, and you're probably operating on adrenaline. Consider the situation carefully and list your tasks in order of urgency. The world won't come to an end if you don't get them all done by the end of the day. In the evening, watch a movie and order a pizza.
