Too much work and the resulting pressure over the past few days may have you feeling too tired to do anything more, Virgo, although your optimism and enthusiasm are still intact. Don't be too hard on yourself if you're dragging by the end of the day. If you take care of yourself, you will soon recharge and be your old self again. In the evening, read a good book.
