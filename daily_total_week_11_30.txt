While opportunities for fun and delightful experiences continue to present themselves, there’s a shift in the air this week that could encourage a more dedicated outlook. This change of heart may come about as a result of mistakes made earlier in the week that may have cost you. A desire to get organized and focus on clean living and a healthier outlook may now seem the better way ahead. Sunday’s New Moon can help you to accomplish your aims.
