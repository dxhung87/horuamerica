This is one of those days in which you need to act or else you will be acted upon, Scorpio. Stubborn, aggressive forces are working counter to your aims. You will find yourself swept up in the thick of things if you aren't careful. Don't get too worried about what other people consider wrong. Have confidence in what you know is right.
