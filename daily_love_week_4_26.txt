When you think about past relationships, what have been your major contributions? Are you proactive when it comes to solving problems or are you the "sit back and wait for everything to work itself out" type? If things haven't worked out in your favor in the past, you might want to think about making some changes. It's tempting to insult or criticize an ex over the weekend, but you're better than that. Smile and say hello and leave it at that.
