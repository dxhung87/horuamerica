You’re been searching for the perfect partner, but during the July 5 Sun/Jupiter square you always seem to end up disappointed for some reason. Are you being too critical or do you deserve more than you’ve been getting recently? Deep down, you know the answer. A Mercury/Saturn trine on July 19 shines an honest spotlight on your love life, and this could be when you realize how things are rather than how you wish they were. Eye-opening experiences aren’t always pleasant, but they’re necessary for growth. Your feelings are hurt easily when Venus enters your sign on July 31. Try not to take things personally.
