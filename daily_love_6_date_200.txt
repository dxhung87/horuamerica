The aspect at play means that you will probably have a pleasant enough day with your loved one. But you may have to watch that you don't upset them inadvertently by thinking you are saying something funny, only to find that you have accidentally upset them. Words may take on different meaning according to the other person's state of mind. Be as inoffensive as possible.
