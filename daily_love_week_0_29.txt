Thereâ€™s no reason to try to go it alone at the start of the week. Enlist the help of friends, relatives, or even professionals to help you in your quest for love. Someone may be intent on calling you out for a past relationship blunder over the weekend, and the more you engage this person, the worse the outcome may be. Setting the record straight on social media will help spread the word.
