Some strange communications could come your way today, Virgo. Hang-ups or blank emails could have you wondering who the person is and what they want from you. This is probably due more to problems with phone lines or Internet connections than to anything else, so don't waste time worrying. If you think you know who's trying to reach you, wait until tomorrow and contact him or her.
