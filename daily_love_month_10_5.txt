You're looking for someone unique or unusual at the Sun/Neptune square on June 4, and just any ordinary relationship won't do. You think too far outside the box to settle for what other people settle for, and the ordinary and mundane can be frustrating and unsatisfying. The Sagittarius Full Moon on June 9 suggests that new exploits are on the way, but something needs to be finalized first. Getting closure is freeing in many ways. A Mars/Jupiter square on June 25 gives you permission to brag about your many talents, but you may be penalized for arrogance or self-centeredness. Sometimes you just can't win.
