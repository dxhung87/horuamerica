There are times for endings, and times for beginnings. Today one particular ending may be the catalyst for a new beginning. It could be a rather intense encounter, which although platonic to start with, may become very involved. It seems that this could be a new development with real bonding power. You may feel as though you have always known each other, though you have only just met.
