An emotional issue could be rubbing you the wrong way, Scorpio. Your impulse is to escape. Try to do so in a healthy manner. Go see a movie or read a book. Don't fall prey to the temptation to indulge in alcohol or food. This will only push the problems away temporarily. When they resurface again, they may be even harder to handle.
