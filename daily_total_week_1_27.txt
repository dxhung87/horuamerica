Mixed messages could lead to misunderstandings this week unless you make yourself very clear. As Mars interacts with nebulous Neptune at the start of the week, you might want to empathize and do your best for a certain person but find that this approach doesn't work. Instead, you might need to create firm boundaries and speak the truth, especially if the person has taken advantage of you. Close friends will be very understanding and supportive of your needs.
