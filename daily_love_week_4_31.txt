Is someone jealous of your budding romantic relationship? Watch out at the start of the week for someone who may be trying to drive a wedge between you and someone you’ve been flirting with lately. You look to the future with interest later in the week, and you can’t help but imagine what life would be like in a long-term partnership. Before you think about settling down, make sure you’re with “the one” and not “the one for right now.”
