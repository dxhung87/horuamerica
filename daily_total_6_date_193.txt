Worries about a relative who lives far away might plague you today, Libra. The situation isn't helped by the fact that you may not be able to reach them by phone or email. You may have to contact mutual friends who can give you the information you need. Circumstances probably aren't all that dire. There's probably nothing to be overly concerned about, but you need to hear this. Keep trying.
