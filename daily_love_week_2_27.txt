Love is a complicated game at the start of the week, and it takes more logic than emotion to figure it out. You aren't exactly cold-hearted, but you've been known to make a cool, calculated maneuver now and then in order to get what you want. The weekend can be frustrating when you have nothing on your social calendar, so try to make plans as far in advance as possible. Take the initiative or sit at home.
