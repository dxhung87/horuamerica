Give your loved ones the attention they need today, Virgo. Don't let another day go by without saying you love them. Life is short and getting shorter with each passing day. Be confrontational about a serious issue that needs addressing. You're responsible for your feelings. Don't play the victim. You'll only experience more pain and resentment later.
