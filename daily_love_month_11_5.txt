An emotional transition occurs when Mars leaves aloof Gemini for deeply sensitive Cancer. You crave the emotional comfort of a committed relationship, so one-night stands and no-strings-attached hookups just aren't your style right now. A Sun/Saturn opposition on June 15 brings a lot of old memories to the forefront, which could complicate things moving forward. If you don't learn from past negative romantic experiences, you may be doomed to repeat the painful process over and over. A Venus/Pluto trine on June 24 opens the door for growth. When seeking new relationships, look for people who can help you conquer fears or get over old hang-ups.
