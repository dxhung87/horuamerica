It's time to get down to work, Sagittarius. At the moment, you can't depend solely on your natural creativity, spontaneity, imagination, and originality to get by. You need to demonstrate a certain amount of pragmatism and self-discipline to reach your goals. This will certainly seem more difficult than it really is. It's time to have faith in attributes other than your intuition.
