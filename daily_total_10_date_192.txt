A disagreement with a friend or family member could cause confusion and hurt feelings if it isn't nipped in the bud. Communication is the key, Aquarius. Avert misunderstanding by explaining in detail exactly what it is you need or what you're prepared to give. Don't assume everyone knows this already. Do this in person if you can. Phone or email might not be as effective.
